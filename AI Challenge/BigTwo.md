## Card Worth
Suits (high to low): Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds.

I.e.: Three Diamonds, Three Clubs, Three Hearts, Three spades, Ace Diamonds...

## Objective
The aim of the game is to **get rid of all of your cards**.  
Who ever achieves this first is the winner.  

Once this occurs the 2nd, 3rd, 4th positions are chose by the number of cards remaining once a player has one.

## Staring a round
The deck is shuffled and 13 cards are dealt to each player.  
If you have the **Three of Diamonds you must start**. You can play it as a single card or in a legal combination. This starts the first trick.  
Players take turns to play on the tick, clockwise (maybe multiple times) around the table.

## Playing on a trick
You must **pass** (player no cards) or **beat the previous player** by playing a higher combination.  
You must **play as many cards as the previous play**, e.g. if it was a pair, you must play a pair.  
You play your cards face up on top of the previous play.

## Winning the trick
You win the trick when **no one can, or wants to beat your last play**.  
That is, when every other player passes in succession.  
When this happens, you win the current trick. The played cards are set aside face down.  

## Starting the next trick
The **winner starts the next trick** by playing any card or legal combination of cards.  
You **cannot start a trick with a pass** - you must play one or more cards.  

## Winning the round
The first player to play all of their cards wins the round.  
As soon as this happens, the round ends and the hands are scored. Other players cannot get rid of their cards after the winning play.


## Scoring
The losers score penalty points for the cards left in their hands.  
The **penalty points per card** are:
 * -1 points if fewer than 10 cards left;
 * -2 points if 10-12 cards left;
 * -3 points if all 13 cards left.

**The winner gains all the points the other players lost.**

## Enging the game
A game ends when either;
 * A player reaches a score greater than or equal to 100 points
 * 10 rounds have beeen completed
Players are ranked by their total score including ties.
